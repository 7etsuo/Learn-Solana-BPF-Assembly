# Appendices for sBPF Assembly

This directory contains supplementary reference materials for sBPF assembly programming.

## Contents

### [1. Complete Opcode Reference Table](./01_opcode_reference.md)
Comprehensive listing of all sBPF instructions, their mnemonics, encodings, and version compatibility.

### [2. Memory Map Reference](./02_memory_map.md)
Detailed information about the sBPF memory layout, including memory regions, their addresses, sizes, and access permissions.

### [3. Sample Linker Script](./03_linker_script.md)
A template linker script for sBPF programs with explanations of each section.

### [4. Compiler and Linker Flags](./04_build_flags.md)
Reference for common compiler and linker flags used for building sBPF programs.

### [5. Register Set and Error Handling](./05_register_reference.md)
Information about the sBPF register set, calling conventions, and error handling mechanisms.

## Purpose

These appendices serve as quick references for sBPF assembly programmers. They complement the main documentation by providing detailed tables and references without interrupting the flow of the main tutorial sections.

The appendices are designed to be consulted as needed during development, providing specifics that might be required for more advanced programming tasks.

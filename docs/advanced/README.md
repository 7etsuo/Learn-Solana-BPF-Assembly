This section will cover advanced topics for sBPF programming on Solana.

## Coming Soon

1. Account Interactions - How to interact with Solana accounts from sBPF programs
2. Cross-Program Invocation - Techniques for calling other programs
3. Program Derived Addresses - Working with PDAs in sBPF
4. Heap Usage - Advanced memory management in sBPF programs

## Prerequisites

Before diving into these advanced topics, you should be familiar with:
- Basic sBPF programming concepts covered in the [Foundations](../foundations/) section
- sBPF instruction set detailed in the [Reference](../reference/) section
- Simple program implementation as shown in the [Examples](../../examples/)
